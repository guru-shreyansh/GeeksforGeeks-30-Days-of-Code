<h3> Day 1 </h3>

<blockquote>Geek and his classmates are playing a prank on their Computer Science teacher. They change places every time the teacher turns to look at the blackboard. 

Each of the N students in the class can be identified by a unique roll number X and each desk has a number i associated with it. Only one student can sit on one desk. 
Each time the teacher turns her back, a student with roll number X sitting on desk number i gets up and takes the place of the student with roll number i.

If the current position of N students in the class is given to you in an array, such that i is the desk number and a[i] is the roll number of the student sitting on the desk, can you modify a[ ] to represent the next position of all the students ?</blockquote>
